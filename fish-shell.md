| `-n __fish_complete_directories STRING DESCRIPTION` | performs path completion on STRING, allowing only directories, and giving them the description DESCRIPTION.
| `-n __fish_complete_path STRING DESCRIPTION`        | performs path completion on STRING, giving them the description DESCRIPTION.
| `-n __fish_complete_groups`                         | prints a list of all user groups with the groups members as description.
| `-n __fish_complete_pids`                           | prints a list of all processes IDs with the command name as description.
| `-n __fish_complete_suffix SUFFIX`                  | performs file completion allowing only files ending in SUFFIX. The mimetype database is used to find a suitable description.
